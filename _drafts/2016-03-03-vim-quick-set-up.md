#Quickly Set Up Vim And Start Coding!
#Vim-primer: quick-start for new users.
Who this is for: Those who have programmed before, flirted with vim beforen, but got hurt,
interested in vim+tmux.

I have recently ventured into Vim terriorty. It was not the easiest ride. In fact it
was full of bumps and sharp turns. I hit my head a few times along the way. But, after
all was said and done, I came out with (sort of) successful results. I wanted to share
the story of my eventful journey with the hopes that the next budding and naive
programmer interested in vim can have more (and faster!) success with starting vim.

Key points:
*Stick to the basics:
    There are a lot of cool and awesome vim plugins out there, but a newbie can quickly
    drown in all the awesomeness. I found myself installing WAY too many plugins because
    I found too many veteran vim users out there recommending all this good stuff. The
    problem, however, came from the fact that I could only justify the plugin being useful
    by pointing to someone elses comment: "because I haven't uses vim extensively, I didn't
    know the downsides to vim, which meant I couldn't understand why x plugin helped me
    out so much." Moral of the story: stick to the basics. Learn and discover the down-
    sides yourself. Use no more than the necessary plugins to get your work done (syntax
    highlighter, colors).
    **Javascript/python syntax, color/themes
*Learn movement commands:
    I found myself becoming frustrated trying to work when the editor itself was in the
    foreground, constantly reminding me that I did not all the shortcuts. Compounded with
    all the plugin shortcuts that I was trying to remember, I was getting frustrated very
    quickly. I found myself cheating; using my arrow keys, the mouse, and, at one point, a
    different editor! I took a step back, downloading a nifty cheat sheet and forced myself only
    move the cursor via move commands. Sure it took longer at first, and I looked pretty dumb
    while I shouted commands out loud to help me remember quicker (it works, try it!), but
    it helped in the long run. I can now resonably get around the terminal, and each day
    I find myself getting faster and the vim fading into the background seamlessly, becoming
    a part of the environment. Moral: learn movement commands first! Built-in tutorial is
    good! Force yourself to use movement commands and it will pay off!

*Tmux key commands:
    A lot of tmux users like to change the leader key (The key that tells the computer that the
    next keystroke(s) is for tmux; this is ctrl-b by default) to ctrl-a and vims leader key to
    ','. I found this really useful. When I want to do things with tmux, my left hand goes into
    what I like to call 'tmux position' and vim is called via the right hand. It helps to have 
    these leader keys invoked by different hands.

*Try it for a month:
    So far, I am half way through my 'trial' with vim. I have wanted to move back to my previous
    editor many times (atom just handles html/css so much better!). But sticking with it, I hope
    to learn new and better ways to handle these problems in vim, and congratulate myself for
    sticking with something I said I would for a month. Let us hope all goes well.
