Goal: To explain generative web pages (dynamic?) using Jekyll as the example.

Key points I want to cover:
===========================

* Define Jekyll
* Explain what Jekyll can do (generate web pages)
* Explain the generation of web pages via bad analogy
* Compare Jekyll to other frameworks like Express and Flask/Django
* Wrap up with the moral of the story: learning general underlying principles
is useful to web development as it lets you pick up various technologies quickly.
