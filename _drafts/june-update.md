I got a job! Woooo! Yaaah!!! The marathon took about four months of stress, doubts,
and hard work, but I think it paid off! Here's a list of things I think that worked
for the whole process and some things that didn't work during the job hunt.

# Know your market
I think I got too caught up in trying to learn everything; making projects in NodeJs,
fiddling around in databases, and trying out new lighting techniques in Photoshop.
These things were all great, but at the end of the day, companies were only interested
in the key requirements listed in the job description, despite the fact that you
are a totally passionate programmer who can and will learn everything.

Knowing the key requirements for the positions you are applying for gives you
the chance to showcase these skills in a specific part of your portfolio. DO IT.

# Actions speak louder than words

I lacked experience on my resume, but I made up for it in a sheer amount of projects
that I worked day and night on. Every time I submitted a resume for a company that I
really liked, I would make a small project for them, highlighting skills they were
looking for. The companies I spoke with loved this and it became a strong selling point
for me, despite my lack of experience in the industry.

Make things that cater to skills that companies are looking for in their job descriptions.

# These actions compound over time

I found that the companies in my area were focusing on two technologies: C# and PHP. Since
I wanted to go the Front End route, I focused on building things in PHP for specific
companies. These PHP projects began accumulating which gave me a stronger selling point,
and the 'company-catered' projects became the 'cherries-on-top'.

# Find allies in the industry

My networking skills are terrible, but I still made it a goal to go out and attend tech
events. I think I still failed miserably, generating only a handful of contacts at the
end of the day, but I learned a lot about the industry. The allies that were most helpful
to me were recruiting agencies. I managed to get into contact with one and we developer a
sort of 'help me to help them' sort of relationship. They were extremely helpful and helped
me get one-on-one time with potential employers. Through them, I was able to land my job.

I definitely recommend this route for those who have inexperienced networking skills or just
need to land a job faster than usual. They get paid to get you a job so that you can get
paid. Everybody is happy in the end!

# Sell Yourself and Assume Nothing

Your resume is like one of those video game descriptions on the back of a box. It's there to
give a description, but ultimately sell the game. If you find that you made it to the phone
interview stage, be prepared to talk about how you know skills they need and your portfolio.
Assume that they never even looked at your portfolio. This is important. I made that mistake
and it cost me.

Later, when I went in for an in-person interview I made a list of things that I had to go
over so that they got the whole picture. Sometimes we can very easily assume the potential
employer knows this or that, or since we live our own lives, it's easy to forget that a
lot of people don't know what you do. Prepare to sell yourself and everything you have done.

# Roll with the Punches

Never went to college? Never finished? Just got stared in the industry? Use these weaknesses
to your advantage. Look at them in a different light and pull strengths out of them. If you
never went to college, this means you're self-taught, and being self-taught means you know
how frustrating it can be to solve hard problems by yourself. But you overcame this and
have become stronger. Sell that.

Just got started in the industry? That means you have limited experience. But that also means,
you're flexible and tenacious. And if you have a strong grasp on the foundational skills,
you can pick up a working knowledge of almost any other technology. Having limited experience
means you have grit and determination to get the job done no matter what. It may not be pretty
and eloquent, but it will get done. Sell that.
