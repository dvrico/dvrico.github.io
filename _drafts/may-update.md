About two weeks ago I wrote a [blog post]() about my journey in the programming world. I now bring you another update on the things I've been focusing on over the past two weeks.

# The job-prep checklist

It took me two weeks to finish my portfolio. I realized a lot my creative energy needed to go into it since I wanted it to be my 'ace' during my job hunt. I came up with a list of things I needed to complete to really get this portfolio up and running:

* Social Media & Other Profiles: Twitter, Behance, GitHub, Linkedin, and even this Blog would contribute to the portfolio and give me a presence on the web.
* Hightlighted projects: A handful of projects would be showcased to show the range of skills that I know
* An actual portfolio site. This was a little easier after I fleshed out the design on Photoshop. The most frustrating part was, of course, knowledge needed to use a DNS and server properly to give my site a place to live on the web. So many docs were read in the wee hours of the night...

After polishing the above, I did a sort of 'marathon project' over the weekend and wrote up a lightweight [social media application]() using PHP. I learned a lot of PHP during the stint and now I have another useful tool (albeit a bit unsharpened) in the toolbox.

# Other projects

Oddly enough, I still haven't finished the [NodeJS chat app](). A lot of my creative energy was focused on getting all the portfolio items done. However, I still learned a lot from the project and will enjoy working on it some more. I have also started up an [interactive storytelling project]() -- my first collaboration piece!

# Let the games begin

And by games, I mean job-hunt. I feel like I'm prepared (read:confident) at last to begin seeking that full-time developer job I so desperately want. The next two weeks should go something like this:

* Research companies hiring in the area
* Submit one app a day
* Practice interview questions
* Work on ongoing projects (chat app & comic app)
* Get a code pen up and running to get working with JS more regularly.
* Beef up Behance profile with more designs
