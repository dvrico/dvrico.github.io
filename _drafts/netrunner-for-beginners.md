Enjoying Netrunner as a beginner

Goal: Explain how beginners can enjoy Netrunner more by adjusting
      thier play style and attitude toward the game.

Points to be covered:
=====================

+ Brief intro to what Netrunner is all about.
+ Compare to Magic: The Gathering to show that if you play it like Magic the game
    will take longer and will generally be unfun when you hit that snare!.
+ Compare to chess to show that the risk in chess is different than the risk in poker.
    Treat it like the risk in poker and youll have a boat load of fun.
+ Compare to poker. Keep it slim, fast, and dangerous.
+ Link to posts on how to play better (other blogs).


Andriod: Netrunner is an asymmetrical, two-player card game. It is set in a dystopian sci-fi fantasy
world where immoral  mega-corporations sell and distribut thier services to the masses. An elite
group of hackers, known as runners, try and thwart the corporations plans by hacking into their
servers to steal vaulable information. 

I got into Netrunner because of the theme and artwork. It was just so cool! And my inner-hacker
nerd couldn't help but gravitate toward it. However, I soon found myself not only losing, but
generally having long and boring games. Where were the pedal-to-the-metal, hanging by the skin
of your teeth games that every was talking about? I soon realized it was because I was playing
the game all wrong.

Playstyle
=========

Now, it wasn't because I was literally playing the game wrong. I definitely has the rules down,
it was actually my attitude towards the game. I approached it like any other strategy game I played,
and that was my first mistake. 

Coming from Magic: The Gathering, another popular card game, all made sure all my moves were
calibrated to the highest efficency. I thought through every possible move before considering the 
best move, and if I was playing the runner, this would take a long time. I would think I made the
right move, only to hit a Snare! from R&D and lose the game in an instant. Later, in my saltiness,
I would blame the loss on the randomness of the game; how could I possibly account for these
death traps when there were a thousand other variables to think about?

Then I began to watch some games on the internet, both casual and pro and I noticed some neat
things.

Poker, not Chess
================
Netrunner should be treated like a game of Poker, not chess. Making this horizontal shift worked
miracles for my time with Netrunner. I kept trying to look and account for the whole board
like a game of chess. If one would change over to Poker, one suddenly sees the chance as a variable
to be captialized on. And it suddenly gets very fun and very risky, and losing to that Snare! isn't
so bad anymore, because you had fun doing it.
