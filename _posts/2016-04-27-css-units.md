CSS Lengths come in all different shapes and sizes. They all derive their units of measurement from different sources and it can be difficult to know when to use which one for your project. This article is an broad overview of  CSS Lengths and contains a few tips on how to use them.

# Relative vs. Absolute

CSS Units come in two flavors: Absolute and Relative. Absolute units include inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, and, of course, pixels. They meet these criteria:

  * These units are self-regulating
  * These units are based off of real-world measurements

Relative units are much different and include percentages (%), `em`s, `rem`s, `ex`s, `ch`s, `vmax`, and `vmin`. These lengths base their units off of one or more of these three criteria:

  * These units are based off of parents' own dimensions
  * These units are based off currently declared font-attributes
  * These units are based off viewport dimensions

In other words, relative lengths derive their units of measurement
from elsewhere in the code. Let's take a closer look at each one.

# Relative Units

## Percentages

Aside from pixels, percentages are units commonly seen in stylesheets and tend to be used a lot for responsive design. Percentages are always relative to another value and are commonly seen basing their units of measurement off ancestor elements. For example, if the `.parent` element is `400px` wide and the `.child` element is `50%` wide, then the `.child` element will render `200px` wide in the browser.

![percentages example](/assets/gifs/css_units/percentages.gif)

The `.parent` div contains two `.child` elements that take up `40%` of the parent's container. Shrinking the viewport scales the parent container down, which in turn shrinks the children containers as well. To retain their width size of `40%`, they must scale down as well.

Developers commonly use percentages in multi-column layouts so that they can fit unpredictable viewport sizes. They are also used to make sites more responsive by assigning elements' width sizes in percentages.

## Font-attribute based units (ex, ch, em, rem)

Font-attribute based units are commonly used with fonts, as the title implies. Some are uncommon, but all are relative units.

## > `ex` unit

The `ex` unit is a uncommon CSS unit. To put it succinctly, `1ex` is equal to the visible height of the letter 'x' (the 'x' character makes a perfect square, so `ex` is technically equal to the width as well.) The actual dimensions of the letter 'x' can change too depending on the `font-size` and `font-family` of 'x', which, in turn, would change the dimensions of the `ex` unit as well.

![ex example](/assets/gifs/css_units/ex_unit.gif)

When the `font-family` of 'x' is changed from `'Times New Roman'` to `'Open Sans'` the `ex` unit adjusts itself along with 'x'.

## > `ch` unit

The `ch` unit is not as uncommon as the `ex` unit, but still not as popular as other values. `1ch` is equal to the *width* of the '0' character. A better way to grasp this is to turn that little guy sideways and stack multiples of '0' on top of each other. You find yourself with a nifty `ch` ruler, too. Again, the dimensions of the `ch` unit will change depending on the `font-size` and `font-family` of the '0' character.

![ex example](/assets/gifs/css_units/ch_unit.gif)

When the `font-family` of '0' is changed from `'Times New Roman'` to `'Open Sans'` the `ch` unit adjusts itself along with '0'.

## > `em` unit

The `em` unit is notorious for being popular and misunderstood at the same time. The most important thing to understand is that `em` units are based off the `font-size` of the element on which they are used. The browser renders `em` values as a multiplication of the `font-size`, i.e if the `font-size` = `20px`, then `1em` = `20px`, `2em` = `40px`, etc.

![em_1 example](/assets/gifs/css_units/em_1.gif)

In this example, the `font-size` is assigned to `20px`. The `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` are assigned `1em`, `2em`, and finally `3em`. Those `em`s get rendered as `20px`, `40px`, and `80px`, respectively.

The `.parent` element can affect these `em` values as well, but this only happens during inheritance (which, in fact, happens all the time because every element automatically inherits the `font-size` of its ancestor).

![em_2 example](/assets/gifs/css_units/em_2.gif)

The `h1` inherits the font-size from the containing element, `.child`. The base `font-size` becomes `16px` which the `em`s can multiply off of.

`em` values can also cascade, which can either be a good thing or terrible thing depending on the situation:

![em_3 example](/assets/gifs/css_units/em_3.gif)

Even though all `h1`s are assigned a `font-size` of `1em`, only the first `h1` renders at `16px`. The rest multiply to greater sizes.

## > `rem` unit

The `rem` unit is similar to the `em` unit, however it derives its units from the *root* element of the page, i.e the `html` element. The `rem` unit is *not* cascading. This gives it a little more stability and dependability compared to the `em` value.

![rem example](/assets/gifs/css_units/rem_unit.gif)

Assigning the `html` a `font-size` of `20px` gives all `rem` values in the document a base of `20px` to multiply off of. If no `font-size` is declared in the `html`, then it defaults to `16px`.

## `em` or `rem`?

Because these two units are similar to each other, a lot of people have trouble knowing when to use either one in their project. It's a hotly debated topic that deserves a whole article to itself, so I won't talk about it thoroughly here. The rule of thumb I've come to adopt comes from [Zell's Blog](http://zellwk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/), which states:

  1. Size in `em` if the property should scale according to itâ€™s font-size
  2. Size everything else in `rem`.

## Viewport Dimensions

The `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, and `vmax` units divides the viewport up into 100 units. When the viewport shrinks or grows in size the elements assigned these units will respond to shrink or grow as well.

## > `vw` and `vh` units

The `vw` and `vh` units stand for view-width and view-height, respectively. If an element is assigned `50vw`, it will render as 50 parts of the viewport-width dimension. Likewise, `vh` unit is dependent on the view-height.

![vw and vh example](/assets/gifs/css_units/vw_vh.gif)

## > `vmin` and `vmax` units

The `vmin` and `vmax` units of length are a little bit trickier. They still derive their values from the viewport, however, they respond only to the largest (or smallest, if `vmin` is being used) of the two viewport dimensions (`width` or `height`) at that moment. In other words, setting an element to `50vmax` will render as 50 parts of the viewport dimension that is the *largest*.

![vmax example](/assets/gifs/css_units/vmax_unit.gif)

When the largest dimension begins to scale down (width in this example), the element will respond accordingly. As you can see, the element ignores the height because it is the smallest viewport dimension, *until* it becomes larger than the width. These principles apply to `vmin` as well, just in reverse:

![vmin example](/assets/gifs/css_units/vmin_unit.gif)

Things can get very mind-bending if you assign element's widths to view-heights and vice versa:

![whacky vh and vw example](/assets/gifs/css_units/wacky_vh_vw.gif)

These units can easily replace percentages that determine the size of the container wrapping the whole site. These can be also be used in [typography](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/) to produce interesting results.

# Absolute Units

Now we head back to some familiar territory! Absolute lengths are... well, just that - absolute. They are self-regulating and are based on real-world measurements. These include inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, and, of course, pixels.

![absolute values comparsion](/assets/gifs/css_units/absoulte_values.png)

You can read all about absolute values at the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths) along with all the math goodies.

## A Word About Pixels

The most common unit seen on the web is the pixel. Most people find themselves thinking in pixels when determining the dimensions of an element because its the easiest. However, the size of the pixel can vary from device to device.

Screens come in all shapes and pixel-sizes, otherwise known as pixel densities. Text can look huge on a large, yet low pixel-density, monitor, taking up more than the screen. But the text suddenly shrinks to half the screen-size when you open it up on an high pixel-density iPhone, despite the it having a physically smaller screen. Just something to keep in mind, especially when designing for mobile.

# Conclusion

As we now know, CSS lengths fall into two categories -- relative and absolute. We've learned some uncommon lengths and some very common lengths. We've also learned the difference between `em` and `rem`. From here, you can dig deeper if you want and check out the sites I linked above. Or you can hit the ground running by playing around in your own project. Hopefully you can now answer the question in the title! Until next time :)
