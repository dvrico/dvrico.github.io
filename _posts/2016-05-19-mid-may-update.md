About two weeks ago I wrote a [blog post](http://dvrico.github.io/blog/may-update/) about my journey so far in the programming world. I now want to bring you another update on the things I've been focusing on over the past two weeks.

# The job-prep checklist

It took me those two weeks to finish my portfolio. I realized a lot my creative energy needed to go into it since I wanted it to be my 'ace' during my job hunt. In the beginning, I came up with a list of things I thought I needed to get my portfolio looking good. The list looked like this:

* Polish Social Media & Other Profiles: Twitter, Behance, GitHub, Linkedin, and even this Blog would contribute to the portfolio and thus needed polishing.
* Showcased projects: A handful of projects would be on the forefront of the portfolio to display skills and competency.
* An actual portfolio site. This was easy after I fleshed out the design on Photoshop. It was time-consuming during the development part. And the most frustrating part was, of course, figuring out how to configure the server and DNS provider properly to give my site a place to live. So many docs were read in the wee hours of the night...

After completing the above, I did a sort of 'marathon project' over the weekend and wrote a lightweight [social media application](https://github.com/dvrico/demo-social-site) using PHP. I learned a lot of PHP during the stint and now I have another useful tool (albeit a bit unsharpened) in the toolbox. It was a nice finish to the week.

# Other projects

Oddly enough, I still haven't finished the [NodeJS chat app](https://github.com/dvrico/share-the-internet). A lot of my creative energy was focused on getting all the portfolio items done. However, I still learned a lot from the project and will enjoy working on it some more. I have also started up an [interactive storytelling project](https://github.com/dvrico/interactive-comic) -- my first collaboration piece!

# Let the games begin

And by games, I mean job-hunt. I feel like I'm prepared (read: confident) at last to begin seeking that full-time developer job I so desperately desire. The next two weeks should go something like this:

* Create a list of local companies to research
* Submit apps to the chosen companies
* Practice interview questions

## And more work!

Other things I plan on poking at during these next two weeks:

* Ongoing projects (chat app & comic app)
* Get working with JS more regularly via CodePen
* Beef up Behance profile with more designs

The climb up these mountains has proved fruitful. I see the summit. However, it's still far off; I have to keep an even, steady pace. I can't get too excited, or else I'll exhaust myself before I reach the top. One step at a time!
