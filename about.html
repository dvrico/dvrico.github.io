<p>Hello, I'm David. I'm a tech enthusiast and developer. I'm currently enjoying full stack web development in Python,
Javascript, PHP, and, soon to be, Ruby. This blog was created to share my thoughts, challenges, and experiences about the tech world.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy literature, writing, Andriod: Netrunner, and climbing. I currently reside in Baltimore, MD.</p>
